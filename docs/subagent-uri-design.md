# Subagent URI Design Across Providers

## Status

Proposed

## Context

`xurl` currently resolves a single thread URI into one local thread file and renders a timeline view. This works for primary conversations, but it does not provide a first-class way to inspect subagent lifecycle state or drill down into a specific subagent context under a parent thread.

The existing URI behavior is inconsistent with subagent use cases because it only models one `session_id` and does not encode parent/child scope in the URI itself.

## Goals

- Keep backward compatibility for existing provider URIs.
- Use one URI shape across providers for subagent drill-down.
- Support both aggregate status and single-agent drill-down.
- Use one explicit CLI mode switch for aggregate listing.
- Make markdown metadata stable for automation consumers.

## Non-Goals

- Defining provider-specific transport details for remote RPC.
- Replacing the existing single-thread render pipeline.
- Introducing provider-specific query parameter syntax for subagent views.

## Unified URI Model

### Existing URIs (unchanged)

- `codex://<thread_id>`
- `codex://threads/<thread_id>`
- `claude://<session_id>`
- Other providers continue their current single-thread form.

### New Drill-Down URI (provider-consistent)

- Drill down into one subagent:
  - `<provider>://<main_thread_id>/<agent_id>`

## CLI Mode Model

### Aggregate Listing

- Aggregate subagents under a parent thread is triggered by `--list`:
  - `xurl '<provider>://<main_thread_id>' --list`

### Single-Agent Drill-Down

- Drill-down view is path-based:
  - `xurl '<provider>://<main_thread_id>/<agent_id>'`

### Mode Constraints

- `--list` requires a parent-thread URI (`<provider>://<main_thread_id>`).
- `--list` is invalid with drill-down URI (`<provider>://<main_thread_id>/<agent_id>`).
- `--list` always renders markdown output.

## Provider Mapping

### Codex

- `agent_id` is treated as a subagent identifier scoped by `main_thread_id`.
- Current local evidence shows `agent_id` commonly equals child thread id, but implementation must still validate parent-child relation.
- Parent lifecycle is inferred from tool calls such as `spawn_agent`, `wait`, `send_input`, `resume_agent`, and `close_agent`.

### Claude

- `agent_id` maps to transcript field `agentId`.
- Candidate files are discovered from:
  - `<project>/<main_session_id>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`
  - `<project>/agent-*.jsonl` filtered by `sessionId == main_session_id`
- Validation should require `isSidechain == true` and matching `sessionId`.

## Resolution Flow

### Aggregate: `<provider>://<main> --list`

1. Resolve and load parent thread.
2. Discover child/subagent records for that provider.
3. Validate parent-child linkage.
4. Build per-agent status summary.
5. Render aggregate markdown.

### Drill-Down: `<provider>://<main>/<agent>`

1. Resolve and load parent thread.
2. Locate target agent/thread using provider mapping rules.
3. Validate linkage between parent and agent.
4. Build lifecycle summary from parent and excerpt from agent transcript.
5. Render combined markdown view.

## Status Normalization

Preferred normalized states:

- `pendingInit`
- `running`
- `completed`
- `errored`
- `shutdown`
- `notFound`

Each response should include `status_source`, for example:

- `protocol`
- `parent_rollout`
- `child_rollout`
- `inferred`

## Output Contract

### Markdown

Use a consistent section layout:

1. `Agent Status Summary`
2. `Lifecycle (Parent Thread)`
3. `Thread Excerpt (Child Thread)`

### Frontmatter

Single-thread timeline output includes YAML frontmatter fields for machine use:

- `uri`
- `thread_source`

## Compatibility Rules

- Existing single-thread URIs must behave exactly as today.
- New subagent support must not require query parameters.
- Parser must reject malformed path shapes with actionable errors.
- CLI must reject invalid mode combinations with actionable errors.

## Risks

- Codex local rollout may miss complete collaboration events.
- Claude status is inferred from local transcripts, not protocol-native.
- `agent_id == child_thread_id` in Codex is observational, not guaranteed by contract.

## Test Scope

- URI parsing unit tests:
  - existing URIs
  - `<provider>://<main>/<agent>`
  - malformed path rejection
- CLI argument tests:
  - `<provider>://<main> --list`
  - `<provider>://<main>/<agent>` without `--list`
  - invalid `--list` with `<provider>://<main>/<agent>`
- Provider tests:
  - Codex parent-child validation and lifecycle extraction
  - Claude file discovery in both known layouts
- CLI integration tests:
  - markdown for aggregate and drill-down URIs
  - stderr warnings and exit-code behavior unchanged
